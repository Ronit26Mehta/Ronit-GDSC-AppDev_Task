the app which has the authorization to login and display welcome msg couldn't connect it to a database but works great and also couldnt got the password visibility toggler
This includes all the major UI specifications fulfilled for a login screen just a visibility toggler for password is not available but would be included in future version 
this also includes a basic authorization mechansim which validates username and password entry by user but it does not have a database connected to it to access the data in real time or added by user
on final note after the authorization  user would be greeted with welcome msg along with email
